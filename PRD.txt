Here is a structured Product Requirements Document (PRD) for **Codehub**. This document serves as the "source of truth" for what you are building, defining the features, scope, and technical constraints for your MERN-based platform.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Codehub

| Project Name | Codehub |
| --- | --- |
| **Author** | Sarthak |
| **Version** | 1.0 (MVP Draft) |
| **Status** | Planning |
| **Tech Stack** | React, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, MongoDB |

## 1. Executive Summary

**Codehub** is a competitive learning platform dedicated to Web Development. Unlike traditional algorithm-heavy platforms (like LeetCode or CodeForces), Codehub focuses on practical, real-world web skills. Users compete to solve frontend UI challenges and backend API logic problems within a browser-based IDE.

### 1.1 Core Value Proposition

* **For Students:** A gamified way to practice React, CSS, and API design without setting up local environments.
* **Differentiation:** Focuses on *visual* and *architectural* web challenges rather than just data structures and algorithms (DSA).

---

## 2. Target Audience

* **Primary:** Computer Science/Engineering students preparing for web development interviews.
* **Secondary:** Self-taught developers looking to build a portfolio through ranked challenges.

---

## 3. Key Features (MVP Scope)

### 3.1 User Management

* **Registration/Login:** Secure auth via Email/Password (JWT).
* **User Profile:** Displays "Global Rank," "Solved Problems," and specific skill badges (e.g., "CSS Wizard", "API Architect").

### 3.2 The Challenge Interface (The Core)

* **Browser-Based IDE:** Integrated code editor (Monaco Editor) with syntax highlighting for JSX, CSS, and JS.
* **Split-Pane View:** Left side for code, right side for live preview (frontend) or console output (backend).
* **Problem Description:** Markdown-supported area explaining the task (e.g., "Create a card component that flips on hover").

### 3.3 Grading & Submission System

* **Frontend Judge (Visual/Functional):**
* *Functional:* Runs unit tests (e.g., React Testing Library) to verify button clicks, state changes, and prop usage.
* *Visual (Optional for MVP):* Checks if the user's DOM structure matches the required elements.


* **Backend Judge (Logic):**
* Sends HTTP requests to the user's Express middleware/functions and validates the JSON response.



### 3.4 Competitive Mechanics

* **Leaderboard:** Global ranking based on Elo rating or total points.
* **Submission Metrics:** Track execution time (performance) and code character count (optimization).

---

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Frontend (React + Tailwind)

* **State Management:** Context API or Redux Toolkit (for managing IDE state and user sessions).
* **Sandboxing:** Use `Sandpack` (by CodeSandbox) or pure `iframe` isolation to render user code safely without crashing the main app.
* **Routing:** React Router v6.

### 4.2 Backend (Node.js + Express)

* **API Layer:** RESTful API to handle user data, fetch problems, and receive submissions.
* **Code Runner Service:** A secure, isolated environment (likely Dockerized containers) to execute backend code submissions to prevent malicious attacks (e.g., `rm -rf /`).

### 4.3 Database (MongoDB)

* **Schema Design:**
* `Users`: Auth details, scores, submission history.
* `Problems`: Title, description, starter code, test cases (hidden), difficulty.
* `Submissions`: UserID, ProblemID, Code, Result (Pass/Fail), Timestamp.



---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Security:** Crucial. User code must strictly be run in a sandbox to prevent XSS (frontend) or Server-Side Remote Code Execution (backend).
* **Performance:** The code editor must load under 2 seconds. Test results should return within 3-5 seconds.
* **Responsiveness:** The UI must be fully responsive (Tailwind), though the coding IDE is optimized for Desktop/Laptop.

---

## 6. Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-2)

* Basic Auth.
* Problem list view.
* Frontend Challenges only (React/CSS).
* Basic automated testing (Pass/Fail).

### Phase 2: Backend & Competition (Months 3-4)

* Node.js/API challenges.
* Global Leaderboard.
* User Profiles.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

* **AI Code Review:** Use GenAI to give personalized hints on *why* a submission failed.
* **Multiplayer:** "Code Clash" mode where two users build the same UI component in real-time.
